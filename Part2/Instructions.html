<ul>
    <li>
        In Part 2 you will face the same 11 machines (you saw in Part 1) in random
        order. For each machine, you will have access only to the notes you took in
        Part 1.
    </li>
    <li>
        For each machine, you will see whether the red or the blue light is on or off
        and you will have to make a prediction about the sound.
    </li>

    <li>
        If Part 2 is selected for payment, we will randomly select one of your
        predictions. If your prediction is correct, we will add $25 to your payoffs.
    </li>
</ul>
