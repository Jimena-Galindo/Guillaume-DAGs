<ul>
    <li>
        In Part 3 you will have to make one more prediction.
    </li>

    <li>
        You will have access to your notes from Part 1.
    </li>
    <li>
        However, in Part 3 you will not be shown both the red and the blue lights
        before making a prediction. Specifically, for each of the 7 machines, you will
        decide whether you want to learn the status of the red light or the status of
        the blue light.
    </li>
    <li>
        After you indicate which of the two lights you would like to see for all 7
        machines, one of the machines is randomly selected. For the randomly
        selected machine, you will learn whether the light you indicated is on or off,
        and you will make a prediction on the sound.
    </li>

    <li>
        If Part 3 is selected for payment and your prediction is correct, we will add
        $25 to your payoffs.
    </li>
</ul>
